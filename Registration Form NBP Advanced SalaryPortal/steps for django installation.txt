Let’s create a virtual environment and activate it:

pip install pipenv
pipenv shell

Install Django and create a project named backend:

pipenv install django
django-admin startproject backend


If everything works you should see the “Congratulations” page from Django.


Navigate to backend/settings.py and add todo to the list of INSTALLED_APPS

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'todo',
]


Django Rest Framework and Django cors headers


1. pip install django djangorestframework     OR pip install django
2. django-admin startproject backendDjango   // this is the project so now we can create apps inside it for render anyting  or for databases
3. django-admin startapp api     // create APP
4. we have to connect that APP with our project to do this , go in settins.py and append 'api.apps.ApiConfig' in INSTALLED_APPS LIST. 'api.apps.ApiConfig' this ApiConfig is class inside apps.py
5. along with above step append also     'rest_framework'
6. we have to create view fro that we have to create endpoint in views.py. Endpoint means location on the server , where u goto like / hello or / hi
7. create urls.py and then did something
8. now run this python .\manage.py makemigrations     // reason  is to update the database
9. python .\manage.py migrate
10. python .\manage.py runserver




In your Django project, you are using Django Rest Framework (DRF) for building your API. DRF is a powerful and widely used toolkit for building Web APIs in Django applications. Here's a recap of what you've used for DRF and some additional components you can utilize in the future:

### What You've Used for DRF:

1. **Generics**: In your `views.py`, you've used DRF's `generics.ListCreateAPIView`, which is a generic class-based view for listing and creating objects. This is a common choice for building API endpoints that provide list and create functionality.

2. **Serializers**: You've defined a `RegistrationSerializer` that handles the transformation of `Registration` model instances into a format that can be easily rendered into JSON or other content types. Serializers are a fundamental part of DRF, allowing you to convert complex data types (such as Django model instances) into native Python data types that can be easily rendered into JSON.

### What Else You Can Use with DRF:

1. **Viewsets**: DRF provides viewsets, which are a more powerful way to work with models and perform common actions (list, create, retrieve, update, and delete) in a concise and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) manner. Viewsets often simplify the view code by combining the logic for multiple HTTP methods (e.g., GET, POST, PUT) into a single class.

2. **Routers**: DRF routers are used to automatically generate the URL patterns for the viewsets. Routers make it easier to manage and organize the URLs of your API endpoints.

3. **Permissions and Authentication**: DRF offers a range of built-in authentication and permission classes to help secure your API. You can easily configure your views to require authentication and define custom permissions for fine-grained access control.

4. **Pagination**: You can set up pagination options for your API views to control the number of items returned in each response, making it suitable for large datasets.

5. **Filters**: You can implement filtering in your API to allow clients to narrow down the results based on certain criteria, such as filtering by specific fields or applying complex queries.

6. **Nested Serializers**: When dealing with related models or nested data structures, you can use DRF's nested serializers to handle the serialization and deserialization of nested objects.

7. **API Versioning**: As your API evolves, you can implement versioning to ensure backward compatibility for existing clients while introducing changes to newer versions of your API.

8. **Throttling**: Implement rate limiting and throttling policies to prevent abuse and control the rate at which clients can make requests to your API.

9. **Custom Endpoints**: You can create custom API endpoints beyond the standard CRUD operations to handle specific actions in your application.

10. **Authentication Tokens and OAuth**: Implement different authentication methods, such as token-based authentication and OAuth, to secure access to your API.

DRF provides extensive documentation and a wide range of features to address various API development needs. You can explore these features as your project requirements evolve, making it a powerful tool for building robust and feature-rich APIs in your Django applications.
